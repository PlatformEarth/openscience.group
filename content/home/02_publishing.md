## Publishing

The purpose of science is to create knowledge for the benefit of humanity. A key pillar of the free and open sharing of scientific knowledge across disciplines and across domains. The Open Science Group's remit is to further these aims by facilitating the widest dissemination of scientific knowledge possible.

## Governance Acting together.

The Open Science Group is a not-for-profit and open member organisation, with the purpose of exploring ways in which the wider community of scientists can come together to express and make decisions aligned with open science principles.
